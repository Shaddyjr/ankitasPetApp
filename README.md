#To Do List
- Automate meta form for users to fill in, based on all shelters
- Add management of metaAnswers
- include auto complete of form for user
- Add Admin priveledges (assigning form questions to user metaAnswers, adding form URLs for shelters missing any or new shelters from users desire (add 'still under construction')) 
- users with missing metaAnswer notifications
- add front-end validation
- abstract configs (and ignore for push)
- refactor old code
- track which shelters user has already applied for
